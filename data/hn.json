We&#x27;re live in thousands of classrooms for in-class assignments, extra practice, and homework. Students work on a whiteboard while our models analyze their work in real time and nudge them with questions that make them think. Teachers get instant visibility into how the class is doing, who needs help, and what to assign next.<p>We just raised our seed round and are backed by the Gates Foundation, giving us the ability to build something transformative in education.<p>Here&#x27;s what you might work on:<p>- Create shareable &quot;aha moment&quot; videos from real student sessions.<p>Turn anonymized whiteboard work and Goblin–student dialogues into short videos or interactive replays that highlight the value of Goblins. Automatically identify the best moments, strip out sensitive data, and produce artifacts that teachers, parents, and districts want to watch and share.<p>- Rewrite our diffusion transformer real-time avatar stack.<p>Our Goblin avatars are already in production. Improve audio–motion sync, temporal coherence, and expressiveness, while cutting latency and cost so they run smoothly at 100k+ student scale.<p>- Extend continuous diagnostics to high-stakes like the SAT and ACT.<p>We track mastery against state standards with our spin on IRT. Extend this to SAT&#x2F;ACT-style exams: infer score distributions from behavior, validate on real data, and compute minimal targeted practice that reliably moves predicted scores.<p>- Design uncheatable problem formats.<p>Generative AI can solve most traditional math problems and show fake work. Build formats where copying is harder than thinking: dynamic graphs, constructive proofs, counterexample generation, debugging flawed solutions, multi-step conceptual checks. Make them auto-gradable, resistant to copy-paste, and stable at scale.<p>- Build real-time instructional agents.<p>Detect underlying student misconceptions from their work and have an agent &quot;drop in&quot; only when needed. It should generate short, visual, 3blue1brown-style explanations tailored to the specific misunderstanding, and create diagrams, animations, and interactive examples that adapt as the student responds.<p>The role is based in our Williamsburg, Brooklyn office in NYC (on-site only). You&#x27;ll join our tight-knit founding engineering team of 3—myself (the CTO) and two founding engineers with collective experience from Stanford, Stripe, Amazon, and X1.<p>As our third founding engineer, you&#x27;ll have full ownership of critical projects and ship production systems that impact thousands of students and teachers in real classrooms within your first few weeks.<p>If this sounds fun, and you want to help inspire 1 billion kids to love to learn, email alp@goblinsapp.com :)",

How private or secure is it to hold your driver&#x27;s license or passport up to a webcam to get a bank account? Was it ever private or secure? Stable diffusion can break so much of this already. Society will need trusted digital IDs and credentials. Our mission is to allow them to be controlled by individuals, with safeguards to prevent descents into surveillance states and checkpoint societies.<p>We are the main implementers of category-defining initiatives such as the digital ID program for the California DMV, and the verifiable digital credentials program in Utah. We are private sector participants in NIST&#x27;s National Cyber Security of Excellence initiative for privacy-preserving digital ID.<p>We are hiring skilled engineers who care about making a real impact in improving public services, digital autonomy, and user privacy for the world. We work closely with public sector agencies, and have high regard for public servants. We have a strong engineering and customer-oriented culture, and are not simply a SaaS product or AI wrapper. Our roles are not for the faint of heart: you will be expected to work hard and learn a lot in this role.<p>Our engineers are ambitious to get outcomes for our customers and their constituents. On any given day, they may write great Rust&#x2F;C#&#x2F;TypeScript, deal with mainframe dumps, read policy documents, respond to technical RFIs&#x2F;RFPs, manage on-prem environments, implement new NFC + Bluetooth protocols in Swift&#x2F;Kotlin, create CI&#x2F;CD processes that enforce W3C accessibility guidelines and i18n requirements, rewrite lost specs from disassembled binaries, figure out stablecoin payments, and design new protections for public key infrastructure. It is a team effort, and people with T-shirt shaped skills are able to collaborate and learn a ton from each other every day.<p>We are interested in candidates who want to be proud of the meaningful impact they make for society, even if it takes time to get right. This is not the right job for someone who wants to &quot;join a cool new AI startup&quot; that implodes or exits in under a year.<p>See our roles here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;sprucesystems&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;sprucesystems&#x2F;</a>",

It the professional language learning application for serious learners.<p>It&#x27;s built with Elixir on the backend, and ClojureScript on the front end. I did try to avoid such an esoteric tech stack, but functional programming and immutable data are just too good.<p>I&#x27;m looking for someone to come in and take over the Elixir backend for a few main reasons:<p>1.

I do some consulting to bootstrap the company with and build customer relations. Simultaenously, we&#x27;re starting to build a product business. For that we have strengthened the team with a Senior ML Engineer (ex google) and a Head of Data with prior experience in setting up data pipelines in this domain. The products we build are in a broad sense trading signals, e.g. to help traders of renewable or flexible assets trade their positions better.<p>Role: So given that it is pretty early days, we&#x27;re of course looking for a broader skillset to lead the development especially of the cloud and backend infrastructure (hetzner), but eventually also frontend applications. Techstack so far is obviously minimal (linux, python, bash, postgres&#x2F;timescale), so there is plenty of room to also shape this. What we as a team value is simplicity, really clean code&#x2F;architectures, excellent documentations and quality over speed. So we&#x27;re not trying to glue together the next venture to scam a bunch of VCs, but to really build something excellent.<p>if that resonates with you, please reach out to me directly via the email address you&#x27;ll find  on our website.",
